## Hello! 💖

I'm Leta (_pronouns are she/her/hers_), and I work as an instructor at [Turing School](https://turing.io) where I teach front-end engineering to people making the jump into tech!

### Pretty good analogies, okay diagrams, bad jokes

Teaching is mostly about getting **out of the dang way**.

I do that by using analogies to relate complex concepts to everyday experiences. I'm also an incurable whiteboarder & doodler, because illustrating those analogies gets at the storytelling part of our brains (and stories, after all, are how human beings learn best). And let me offer many apologies for my excruciatingly unfunny jokes, of which there are an inexcusable amount.

I aspire to blend humor, kindness, patience into my teaching style. Basically, I hope to bring the same energy to JavaScript as Carl Sagan brought to astronomy and quantum physics.

### The deets: Leta in 100 words

I'm a jack of only a slightly silly number of trades. I've always been ashamed of my directionless (omnidirectional?) curiosity, but I recently learned the term "[multipotentialite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZdcB6bjI8)," and holy smokes, it explains SO MUCH.

I believe:

- in medium talk (let's skip the small talk, please)
- that impact matters more than intent
- that social justice and equity are things everyone should be striving for
- that everything is political and thinking otherwise is privilege
- that ghosts and cryptids are not real AND ALSO I wish they were
- that car camping is the superior form of camping
- that rice is a perfect food
